The application consists of two sub-activities:

To-Do List

In the To-Do List the user should be able to add/remove item headings, details and due dates
The user should be able to complete the task if completed
There should be an in-app notification/alert when the due date is the current date

Sensor Tracking

There should be 2 graphs that are continuously showing real-time data of the gyro and accelerometer sensors mentioned.
If there is very high movement on any two axis' at the same time, please create an alert that says "ALERT"
